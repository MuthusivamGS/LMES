    "- **Dataset description**: The dataset contains information about a group of test subjects and their sleep patterns.\n",
    "    - Each test subject is identified by a unique \"**Subject ID**\" and their **age** and **gender** are also recorded.\n",
    "    - The \"**Bedtime**\" and \"**Wakeup time**\" features indicate when each subject goes to bed and wakes up each day, and the \"**Sleep duration**\" feature records the total amount of time each subject slept in hours.\n",
    "    - The \"**Sleep efficiency**\" feature is a measure of the proportion of time spent in bed that is actually spent asleep.\n",
    "    - The \"**REM sleep percentage**\", \"**Deep sleep percentage**\", and \"**Light sleep percentage**\" features indicate the amount of time each subject spent in each stage of sleep.\n",
    "    - The \"**Awakenings**\" feature records the number of times each subject wakes up during the night.\n",
    "    - Additionally, the dataset includes information about each subject's **caffeine** and **alcohol** consumption in the 24 hours prior to bedtime, their **smoking** status, and their **exercise** frequency.\n",

    "**Dataset Collection Methodology:**\n",
    "The study aimed to investigate the impact of lifestyle factors such as caffeine, alcohol, and exercise on sleep patterns and sleep quality. The team recruited participants from the local community and collected data over a period of several months. The data was collected using a combination of self-reported surveys, actigraphy, and polysomnography which is a sleep monitoring technique.\n",

    "**Data Analysis Goal:**\n",
    "The data was then analyzed to **understand the relationship between lifestyle factors** and **sleep patterns** and to identify any potential areas for intervention to improve sleep."
